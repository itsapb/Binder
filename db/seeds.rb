                He offers her the chance to be happy, the freedom to paint,

                As much a cultural and historical marker as an absorbing thriller,
                George Orwell’s 1984 changed and continues to change the way we think about the past and imagine

                1984 resonates so completely have to become part of our commonplace lexicon,
                with words like doublethink and Big Brother (it was also Orwell who first coined the term ‘Cold War’)

  author: "Coco Mellors",
  description: "New York is slipping from Cleo's grasp.
  Sure, she's at a different party every other night,
  but she barely knows anyone. Her student visa is running out,
  and she doesn't even have money for cigarettes. But then she meets Frank.
  Twenty years older, Frank's life is full of all the success and excess that Cleo's lacks.
  He offers her the chance to be happy, the freedom to paint,
  and the opportunity to apply for a green card.
  She offers him a life imbued with beauty and art-and,
  hopefully, a reason to cut back on his drinking.
  He is everything she needs right now.

  Cleo and Frank run head-first into a romance that neither of them can quite keep up with.
  It reshapes their lives and the lives of those around them,
  whether that's Cleo's best friend struggling to embrace his gender identity in the wake of her marriage,
  or Frank's financially dependent sister arranging sugar daddy dates after being
  cut off. Ultimately, this chance meeting between two strangers outside of a
  New Year's Eve party changes everything, for better or worse.",
