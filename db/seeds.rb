                Twenty years older, Frank's life is full of all the success and excess that Cleo's lacks.
                He offers her the chance to be happy, the freedom to paint,
                and the opportunity to apply for a green card.
                She offers him a life imbued with beauty and art-and,

                Cleo and Frank run head-first into a romance that neither of them can quite keep up with.

                cut off. Ultimately, this chance meeting between two strangers outside of a
